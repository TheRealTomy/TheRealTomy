## 🎈 Hi, my name is Tomy

I'm currently learning some languages, and I have some projects! :D
Don't expect a perfect work from me, because as I said, I am only learning! 😃
I am interested in almost everything related to code!
I like making stuff such as prank viruses, but I also make my friendly software :D

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
## 🎓 Languages 

Some of the languages I am learning about are:

* Python
* HTML
* Batch
* JavaScript
* Swift

But there are also a bunch languages I want to learn but are not included in this list.
